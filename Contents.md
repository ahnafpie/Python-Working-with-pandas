## Python Working with pandas

In this project, I've tried to get you some basic function of working with pandas, working with dataset and introduced **Jupyter Notebook** environment. There are seven files in this 
repository. All of them are sorted sequally. Firt sixes are written in jupyter environment, so you can understand properly. I've used here ```pandas``` and ```geopy``` library

**How to install Jupyter Notebook**
- It's easy. Open your cmd type ```pip install jupyterlab```, press enter and it's done.
- To open Jupyter environment go to cmd and command ```jupyter notebook```, this will redirect you to the jupyter notebook.
- If you get troubled, you can follow this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZ952vChhuI&t=89s) as well.

**What we will learn**

* Introduction to ```pandas``` library
* Loading local data set with pandas. Datasets are used in this repository are stored in the *sample file* folder.
  * .csv 
  * .txt
  * .json
  * .excel  
>for prevewing excel file install xlrd; cmd ```pip install xlrd```
* Working with dataset: row & column.
  * Adding, deletation
  * Slicing
  * Indexing
* Working with ```geopy``` library and ```ArcGIS``` module.
* Extracting latitude and longitude from address dataset using ```geopy, geocoders, Arcgis``` modules and ```pandas``` library in ```python3```.
